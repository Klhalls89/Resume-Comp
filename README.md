# Resume-Comp

For this staic composition challenge we were asked to to a resume-style web page using css flex and grid. Because it's due date was Halloween I gave it a spooky theme. The color palette is pumpkin spice and the resume belongs to an evil wizard. Your in for a trick or treat with this, the hardest css challenge I've ever tackled.
